	-	DESCRIPTION
Integrate participating cities into a "Smart, united system".
This system will be a central hub where information about public locations (national heritage sites, museums, public parcs, etc) will be rendered accessible to the "customers" (registered users) and that will interact as a payment and traffic tracker.
The goal of this system is to use available location data (through Google Places and system-gathered data) to handle tourism, smart-city traffic and help both customers and the government to manage the daily workings.
